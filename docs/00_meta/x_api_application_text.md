# X API Application Text (English)

Use the following text when applying for the X Developer Platform or describing your App usage.

## 1. Core Use Case (Intended Use)

> **Question:** Describe how you plan to use Twitter data and/or API.

I am developing a news automation bot for my financial media website, "FinShift". The purpose of this bot is to automatically post summaries of financial market analysis and news articles that are generated on my website.
This helps my audience (swing traders and investors) stay updated with the latest market trends (US stocks, Forex, Crypto) in real-time.
The system is read-only regarding Twitter content; it primarily uses the "Write" endpoint to post tweets. I do not plan to analyze Twitter data or track user metrics.

## 2. Specifics (Content & Interaction)

> **Question:** Will your app use Tweet, Retweet, Like, Follow, or Direct Message functionality?

Yes, the app will use the "Tweet" functionality.
When a new article or market briefing is published on my website (FinShift), the system will automatically generate a short summary (under 280 characters) with a link to the full article and post it to my X account.
The posting frequency will be approximately 2-5 times per day.
The app will NOT perform any automated Retweeting, Liking, Following, or Direct Messaging. All interactions other than posting updates will be done manually by me using the standard Twitter client.

## 3. Display of Data

> **Question:** How will you display Tweets or Twitter content in your app?

My application is a backend script running on a server and does not have a user-facing frontend interface that displays Tweets.
It does not display Twitter content to any users. It only pushes content TO Twitter.

## 4. Government Entity

> **Question:** Will your product, service, or analysis make Twitter content or derived information available to a government entity?

No.
